    description: "It only took a moment in front of one façade to understand what Le Corbusier was searching for here: bringing the building closer to the people who would experience it. He fragments it. Breaks it apart. Creates small moments to inhabit. Staircases, openings, lecterns. Perched on top of the hill, this object could easily feel detached from the landscape, almost imposed upon it. Yet these fragments make it intimate. Approachable. They invite occupation and appropriation. They give a human scale to the great sloping walls, softening what might otherwise feel like a single, monolithic form.\n\nNotre Dame du Haut, Ronchamp, France.",

    description: "On such a bright day, all I could think about was how the immense concrete mass that greets you slowly dissolves into slender supports, as if it were fading away just to touch the ground. Surrounded by such an untouched landscape, the contrast between architecture and nature becomes even more intense. The weight of the concrete longs to meet the grass. The scale of the building gradually breaks apart, allowing itself to merge with its surroundings. The grass seems to flow into the building, or perhaps the building simply opens itself to the landscape.\n\nSainte Marie de La Tourette, Éveux, France.",
